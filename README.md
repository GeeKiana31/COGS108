# COGS108
## Neural Analytics Course @ UCI Cognitive Sciences

This contains course files developed for my course @ UCI - COGS 108 Neural Analytics.  
Some of the data files included here are modified from other open source repositories which are cited.  

Some of the course materials are from COGS 14P Scientific Python.  This material is made available as a Python review.

All of the exercises and projects in this class make use of the Python programming language.  Install Anaconda Python Libraries on your (Windows, Mac, or Linux) computer.

## Why Anaconda Python?

Your computer may already have Python installed on it, which in principle you could configure to use for this class.  It is much easier to simply install the Anaconda distribution of Python which is free and comes with an nearly complete library of software for scientific computing as well as a number of other useful tools like the **Jupyter Lab** IDE.

## VS CODE

My preferred IDE for Jupyter Notebooks is Visual Studio Code.

There is no requirement to use VS code.  You can use Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab, if you are already used to them and like them. Some people like PyCharm.  All of the materials in this class should work in any IDE.  

## Git

What would make this the most effective is if you were to make use of git software to interact with the repository.  This can either be done with commmand line tools (better) or using GitHub Desktop

The official instructions for setting up command line tools are available here -

I actually thought this unofficial one is good too.

I would be up for trying to get this to work, and helping you do so. But, I also know there is overhead to doing it this way, so you might want to take an easier option of using GitHub Desktop, which I have been told is just as good.
